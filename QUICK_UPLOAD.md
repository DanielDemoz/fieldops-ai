# Quick Upload to GitHub

Your repository is ready: https://github.com/DanielDemoz/fieldops-ai

## Method 1: Use the Batch File (Easiest)

**Simply double-click:** `UPLOAD_TO_GITHUB.bat`

This will automatically:
1. Initialize Git (if needed)
2. Add all files
3. Create initial commit
4. Push to GitHub

**Note:** You'll need to enter your GitHub credentials when prompted.

## Method 2: Manual Upload

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\asbda\FieldOp AI"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - FieldOps AI platform by Brukd Consultancy"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/DanielDemoz/fieldops-ai.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Authentication

If you're asked for credentials:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use the token as your password when pushing

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
gh auth login
```

Then use regular push commands.

## After Upload

Once uploaded, your repository will be available at:
**https://github.com/DanielDemoz/fieldops-ai**

You can:
- View the code
- Share the repository link
- Use GitHub Pages to host the HTML demo
- Collaborate with team members

## Troubleshooting

### "remote origin already exists"
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DanielDemoz/fieldops-ai.git
```

### "Authentication failed"
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys for GitHub

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure you have write access to the repository
- Verify you're using the correct GitHub account
